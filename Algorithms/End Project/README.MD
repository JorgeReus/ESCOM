# Minimum Spanning tree Algorithm Comparison
Comparison of algorithms that find the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph(animated).

### Requirements:
    Python 3.6.x
    matplotlib 1.x
    networkx 1.9
    pqdict

## How to run:
python file.py

## Structure
kruskal_animation.py and prim_animation are standalone animations for it's respective algorithm, comparison_animation.py runs both animations at the same time.
prim.py and kruskal.py contain only algorithms
